# Overview

CRM Orbit brings together essential CRM functions in a single, self‑hosted application. It aims to be both simple to get started with and flexible enough to adapt to varied sales and support processes. The project is in active development, and your feedback and contributions are welcome.

## Core features

- Contact & company management – store and update details about people and organisations.

- Deal tracking & pipeline – manage opportunities and track them through a customisable sales pipeline.

- Task management & reminders – create follow‑ups, assign tasks and never miss a due date.

- Multilingual UI – thanks to the Weblate integration, the interface is translatable into multiple languages.

- Healthy codebase – automated CodeQL scanning, Dependabot updates and ESLint rules help maintain quality.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Masked-Kunsiquat/crm-orbit2.git` and change into the project directory.

2. Install dependencies: `run npm install` (or `yarn install`) to install the required packages.

3. Run the development server: `npx expo start -c`
